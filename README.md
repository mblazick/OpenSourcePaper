**Introduction:**

In this essay, I'll be addressing some basics of open source and a pro open source prespective on the spectacular force open source carries.

## **Opensource**
How much time does it take for one person alone to program an entire operating system with plugins and extremely efficent processes? Thats a good question! Just not for Richard Stallman. Richard Stallman is a major activist for free software and wouldn't you know, he wants to make software available to everyone. Open source breeds controversey through businesses owners and software developers alike.  
## **So what is it?**
Open source simply is allowing other people and entities commit changes to the (program, website, book) then release those changes to the public (depending). Open source potentially allows the entirity of some population the opportunity to make changes to a system. This more than tripples the amount of manpower available from just some simple company with 30 dedicated programmers. Whats even more important, is open source brings prespective.  
## **Where's the momentum?**
Numerous companies jumped aboard the open source train creating programming different versions and twists of linux based on their own needs. Some of these companies such as Red Hat are extremely popular and still making changes to their different versions of Linux. Although the core operating system was released in 1994, linux has been a prime of example of how quickly and easily a system can grow with the help of the community. The momentum with open source lies with the world and its population.  
## **Education is the first step**
Educating todays youth is the key to moving society forward as a whole. The more openly available materials are for programming and editing some of these services is extremely important to their survival. Imagine the number of websites that would be available if every shcool in America required that highschool students take not just an intro to computers (really just microsoft word and excel classes) but take 1 programming language before graduation. This could be something as simple as html, css or more dificult languages such as c# or java. I believe the easy access to computers and education over how they operate will create a cusiosity for all things computers.  
## **Why choose open source?**
I believe open source is the best way to develop a program. Open source is made by consumers, therefore made with the consumer in mind. When non open source products are sold they have the consumer in mind, in a much different way. Instead of "How can this program be useful to us?" the thought process changes dramatically to "How can the consumer be useful to us?". This gets some companies into murky waters as they sell, exchange, transfer and store data on their users.  
## **Conclusion**
In concclusion,  
open source has a huge momentum building as we as humans become more and more educated/immersed with computers and their software. Through availability of software and learning, open source could become the only way things are released. Imagine, the entire community working together to enhance your favorite video game. The amount of updates being released would be immense, not to mention the quality (with the user in mind).
